Feature: Test the functionality that filters the SNV variants based on specified filter criteria


  Scenario Outline: Filter-out a SNV variant that has a location value as 'intronic' when the ova, function and exon are missing
    #   If snv has the location annotated (not guaranteed) and that
    #   annotation states that it is intronic, reject the snv as those should
    #   not be in the variant report.

    #  Some variants are not annotated with location and if this is the case
    #  check the identifier, ova, exon, and function. If all of those are
    #  missing than the location is intronic and we filter it out.

    Given a tsv variant report file file "<tsvFile>" and treatment arms file "<TAFile>"
    When call the amoi rest service
    Then moi report is returned with the snv variant "match769.2" as an amoi
    And amoi treatment arm names for snv variant "match769.2" include:
    """
